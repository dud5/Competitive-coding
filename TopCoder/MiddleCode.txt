PROBLEM STATEMENT
Hero is learning a new algorithm to encode a string.
You are given a String s that consists of lowercase letters only.
Your task is to simulate the algorithm described below on this string, so that Hero can see how it works.

The algorithm starts with a given input string s and an empty output string t.
The execution of the algorithm consists of multiple steps.
In each step, s and t are modified as follows:

If the length of s is odd, the middle character of s is added to the end of t, and then deleted from s.
If the length of s is even, the two characters in the middle of s are compared. The smaller one of them (either one in case of a tie) is added to the end of t, and then deleted from s.

If after some step the string s is empty, the algorithm terminates.
The output of the algorithm is the final string t.

Return the String t that will be produced by the above algorithm for the given String s.

DEFINITION
Class:MiddleCode
Method:encode
Parameters:String
Returns:String
Method signature:String encode(String s)


NOTES
-When comparing letters, the smaller one is the one earlier in the alphabet - i.e., the character with the smaller ASCII code.


CONSTRAINTS
-s will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character in s will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').


EXAMPLES

0)
"word"

Returns: "ordw"


In the first step, 'o' is smaller than 'r', thus 'o' is selected.
After the first step: s="wrd", t="o".
After the second step: s="wd", t="or".
In the third step, 'w' is greater than 'd', thus 'd' is selected.
After the third step: s="w", t="ord".
After the fourth step: s="", t="ordw", and the algorithm terminates.


1)
"aaaaa"

Returns: "aaaaa"



2)
"abacaba"

Returns: "caabbaa"



3)
"shjegr"

Returns: "ejghrs"



4)
"adafaaaadafawafwfasdaa"

Returns: "afawadafawafaafsadadaa"
